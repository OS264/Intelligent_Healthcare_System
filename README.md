# 🏥 HealthAI Assistant  
### Intelligent Multimodal Health Management Platform

HealthAI Assistant is a **full-stack, AI-powered healthcare ecosystem** designed to streamline early-stage patient care by combining **multimodal AI, predictive diagnostics, geospatial intelligence, and automated teleconsultation workflows** into a single production-grade platform.

This project demonstrates **advanced AI system design, full-stack orchestration, and real-world healthcare problem solving**.

---

## ✨ Project Highlights
- Multimodal AI core (text + vision)
- Large Language Models for clinical reasoning
- Automated telemedicine & payment workflow
- Real-time hospital discovery using geospatial data
- End-to-end AI + backend + frontend integration

---

## 🧠 Multimodal AI Core

### 1️⃣ Clinical Entity Extraction (Vision + Text)
- Implemented **Llama 4 Scout (17B Vision)** to process **unstructured medical PDFs, lab reports, and scanned documents**.
- The model reads and understands:
  - Lab values
  - Medical terminology
  - Diagnostic indicators
- Automatically extracts critical patient information from **visual and textual medical data**.

> This enables the system to *“read reports”* and *“see medical documents”* like a clinician.

---

### 2️⃣ Predictive Diagnostics & Clinical Reasoning
- Integrated **Llama 3.3 (70B)** as the conversational and reasoning engine.
- Provides:
  - Symptom-based disease prediction
  - Personalized recovery and precaution plans
  - Context-aware medical guidance
- High-parameter architecture allows **nuanced medical reasoning**, outperforming smaller models in complex health scenarios.

## 🏗️ System Architecture & Workflows

### 🔹 Backend & Orchestration
- Built using **Python + Flask**
- Handles:
  - Model inference
  - Workflow automation
  - API orchestration
  - Secure request handling

---

### 🌍 Geospatial Intelligence (Care Discovery)
- Integrated **Leaflet.js** with **Overpass API**
- Uses live geolocation to:
  - Identify nearby hospitals
  - Display facilities on an interactive map
- Bridges the gap between **diagnosis and treatment access**.

---

### 💳 FinTech + Telemedicine Automation
Designed a **complete business logic loop**:

1. User receives AI-based diagnosis  
2. System generates **UPI QR code** for payment simulation  
3. After confirmation:
   - **Google Meet link** is dynamically created
   - Appointment details are auto-generated  
4. Confirmation is sent via **SMTP email automation**

> This workflow demonstrates understanding of **monetizable, real-world healthcare systems**.
