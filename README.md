🏥 HealthAI Assistant: Intelligent Health Management Platform
✨ Project Overview
The HealthAI Assistant is a comprehensive, full-stack application built with Flask and Python that aims to revolutionize the initial patient journey. It integrates complex features Machine Learning, Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and external APIs to provide users with immediate, intelligent health assessments and a seamless path to specialist care.
This project demonstrates strong full-stack proficiency, complex system integration, and responsible use of AI in a sensitive domain.
🚀 Core Features & Functionality
1. Symptom-Based Disease Triage (ML Model)
•	Prediction: Utilizes a pre-trained Random Forest model to accurately predict a probable disease based on up to five user-input symptoms.
•	Guidance: Provides detailed output including the disease description, precautions, recommended medications, diet plans, and workout routines.
2. Medical Report Analyzer (OCR)
•	Data Extraction: Employs pdfplumber, pdf2image, and pytesseract (OCR) to extract text from uploaded PDF or image medical reports.
•	Intelligent Flagging: Runs a rule-based engine on the extracted text to identify and flag critical health markers (e.g., high cholesterol, abnormal blood pressure), providing immediate, context-specific advice.
•	Specialist Recommendation: Recommends the most appropriate medical specialist based on the identified issues and keywords in the report.
3. AI Chatbot (Dual-Mode)
•	GPT Integration: Connects with the OpenAI API to provide an empathetic, generalized health Q&A service.
•	Local Knowledge Base: Features a fallback chatbot that uses the local datasets for accurate, specific information on predicted diseases and recovery plans.
4. Automated Teleconsultation Booking
•	Payment Integration: Calculates the consultation fee, generates a unique UPI QR code for simulated payment, and handles the confirmation flow.
•	Appointment Confirmation: Generates a unique Google Meet link and sends the final booking details, including the virtual meeting link, directly to the patient's email via SMTP/Gmail.
5. Utilities
•	Hospital Finder: Integrates with the Overpass API (OpenStreetMap) to display nearby hospital locations based on user coordinates.
