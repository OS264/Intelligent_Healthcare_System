🏥 HealthAI Assistant: Intelligent Health Management Platform

✨ Project Overview
HealthAI Assistant is a full-stack AI-powered health management system built with Flask and Python. It streamlines the early patient-care process by integrating Machine Learning, OCR-based report analysis, chatbot assistance, and automated teleconsultation workflows into one intelligent platform.
The system demonstrates strong full-stack engineering, healthcare domain understanding, and end-to-end AI integration.

🚀 Core Features
1. Symptom-Based Disease Prediction (ML Model)
•	Predicts the most probable disease using a trained Random Forest model.
•	Accepts up to five symptoms from the user.
•	Returns disease description, precautions, medication suggestions, diet plans, and workout routines.
 
2. Specialist Doctor Recommendation (Disease-Based Referral Engine)
•	Automatically recommends the most suitable medical specialist based on the disease predicted by the Machine Learning model.
•	Uses an intelligent mapping system that links each predicted disease to the correct specialist category.

•	Ensures users immediately understand which doctor to consult, reducing confusion and enabling timely medical action.
•	Displayed along with disease description, precautions, medicines, and recovery plan for a complete health guidance experience.
 
3. Dual-Mode AI Chatbot
•	GPT-powered chatbot connected to OpenAI API for general queries.
•	Offline fallback chatbot uses internal datasets for disease-specific assistance.
 
4. Teleconsultation & Appointment Booking
•	Generates UPI QR codes for payment simulation.
•	Creates unique Google Meet links for appointments.
•	Sends confirmation via automated email (SMTP).
  
5. Nearby Hospital Finder
•	Integrates Overpass API to locate hospitals based on user coordinates.
